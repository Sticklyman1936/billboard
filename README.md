### Note

This requires PyQt4 to be installed on the system. It seems it currently cannot
be deployed with pip, so it's not mentioned in the dependencies.


### TODO

- Currently a bunch of stuff is hard-coded that should be configurable (e.g.
  subreddits to pull images/text from)
- Add more sources (currently, only Reddit)
- An ability to remotely send images/text to the billboard for immediate display
- Take screenshot of the current display and serve it over HTTP
- Support Python 2
- Switch to PyQt5
- ...
